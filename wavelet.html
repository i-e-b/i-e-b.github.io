    <h1>Wavelet image compression</h1>
    <p>General notes from experiments using wavelets for image compression.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the project is to make a file format for images that meets these goals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Compete with PNG and JPG in terms of file size for a given image quality</li>
        <li>Support reconstruction of a partial image from a truncated data source</li>
        <li>Support animations / video with minimal complexity</li>
        <li>Support arbitrary color spaces / channel counts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Non-goals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Work in constrained memory</li>
        <li>Be best-in-class for speed or resulting file size</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Code for these experiments is in the project at <a href="https://github.com/i-e-b/ImageTools">https://github.com/i-e-b/ImageTools</a></p>

    <h3>Planar separation</h3>
    <p>The wavelet transform is inherently 1 dimensional. There are a few different ways to apply this to planar images (2D) and video (3D).
    I have looked into planar separation (applying the transform alternately to each individual row and column of the image) and spacefilling curve transforms (where we transform the image into a single 1 dimensional array and apply to transform in a single pass).</p>

    <h4>Planar 3</h4>
    <p>The method I've seen in most work (including JPEG2000) is what I'll call <i>Planar 3</i>, as it results in 3 sets of wavelet coefficients
    per decomposition round.</p>

    <img src="img/wave_planar3_struct.png" alt="data structure of Planar 3, showing 3 sets of coefficients per round"/>
    <p>This includes a double-decomposition of coefficients in the HH region (marked 1, 4, 7 in the structure image).
    My tests show that this both increases computation and reduces compression efficiency (i.e. gives larger file sizes for the
    same input)</p>
    <h4>Planar 2</h4>
    <p>Instead, I propose 'Planar 2', which produces 2 sets of wavelet coefficients per decomposition round.</p>

    <img src="img/wave_planar2_struct.png" alt="data structure of Planar 2, showing 2 sets of coefficients per round"/>
    <p>This reduces computation of the wavelet transform by 0.25, as the HH section is not calculated. It also improves
    resulting file size: Using test image 3 and no quantisation <tt>Planar 3 = 691kb</tt>, <tt>Planar 2 = 655kb</tt>, or about 5% improvement.</p>

    <h3>Space filling curves</h3>
    <p>I experimented using the 'Z order' and 'Hilbert' curves as spatial transforms. Both of these added significant processing time to perform the transform,
    introduced significant compression artifacts during quantisation, and resulted in overall larger image sizes. I would consider this a strong failure.</p>
    <p>Using test image 3 and no quantisation: <tt>Planar 2 = 655kb</tt>, <tt>Z-order = 871kb</tt></p>
